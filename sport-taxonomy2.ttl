They may perform to recorded music, or the live music of an accompanying marching band ; (c) a team that execute routines carrying either one or multiple flags or pom-poms. This team's movements are also based in dance and may also have a heavy influence of gymnastics as well.

This bar is used as an accelerator depending on the strength of the wind. The navigation methods and rules are those of sailing."@en.
